# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview

   The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by City Type (urban, suburban, rural). We will use pandas. matplotlib, and create a multi-line graph showing the total weekly fare for each city type.
  
## Results

 ### Data results found:
 
- The total rides in Urban Cities were about 89% in comparison to the Suburban areas, and over a 150% increase comparable to the rural areas.

- There are triple the drivers in Urban areas from the Suburban and Rural Areas.

- The total fares in Urban Areas far exceed rural and suburban areas.

- The average fare ride is cheaper in urban areas at $24.53, Suburban at $30.97, and rural areas $34.62 per ride.

- The average fare per driver for Urban is $16.57, Suburban area $39.50, and Rural $55.49.

### Multi-line Graph View:

 We have prepared a multiline graph for visual purposes to see the total fares for the Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas from Jan 2019-April 2019, and found the folloiwng results:
 
- Urban fares range from $1700 to $2500 with slight decrease in between March-April, but increased again in April remaining steady.

- Suburban fares range from $700-$1400 with a decrease in March increasing again toward the middle of April.

- Rural fares range from about $200-$500 with the highest increase toward the end of February, and again in Aprl, but remained steady.

## Summary

#Three business recommendations
  
  - Reviewing the summary we can recommend to the CEO of PyBer to input funds into the marketing strategies to increase the total rides to coincide with drivers in the urban areas.
  
  - The second recommendation would be to decrease the average fare per ride in the rural area to increase total rides. The decrease in fare by a few dollars could potentially increase the total rides.
  
- The third business suggestion would be to increase marketing strategies in the suburban area in March to keep the increase flowing from February. This would change the dynamic from the steady flow that appears from January- April.as they seem to remain pretty steady from January-April.
